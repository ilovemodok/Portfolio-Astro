            I was contacted by Cranimals to come up with a new character,
            codename “Charlie” and package design for new line of “Zendog” dog
            treats.

              Mixing cute doggy character packaging we often see in the aisles

            We decided on which parts of which sketches were what they wanted

            They added that they'd like Charlie sitting on a giant pumpkin
            surrounded by cranberries since those were both key ingredients to
            their vegan dog food.

              With the final pencils approved, I went to work on vectoring and
              coloring the art in Adobe Illustrator. It was a bit of a
              challenge coming up with colors, but I decided to use the big
              pumpkin Charlie was now sitting on as inspiration! I was able to
              play off the oranges not only to design Charlie (with browns
              that have tints of orange), but also to design the whole
              package.

            Upon final approval, the packaging was set up and printed. The
            results were great, with Cranimals winning Pet Product New
            Editor’s Choice 2010 Seal of Approval, even cheekily adding that
            the ‘animated’ cover model Charlie was a big part of their
            success. This was a fun team to work with. It also allowed me to
            use my illustration along with my graphic design skills to come up
            with a fun concept that had great results. A win for everyone,
            especially vegan dogs!
